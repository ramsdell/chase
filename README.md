# Chase: A Model Finder for Finitary Geometric Logic

The chase program is a model finder for first order logic with
equality.  It finds minimal models of a theory expressed in finitary
geometric form, where functions in models may be partial.  A formula
is in finitary geometric form if it is a sentence consisting of a
single implication, the antecedent is a conjunction of atomic
formulas, and the consequent is a disjunction.  Each disjunct is a
possibly existentially quantified conjunction of atomic formulas.  A
function is partial if it is defined only on a proper subset of its
domain.

## Installing From OPAM

    $ opam install chase

## Installing From Sources

This software uses ocaml, opam, getopt, and dune.  See
<http://ocaml.org> for ocaml installation instructions.  Install getopt
and dune with:

    $ opam install getopt dune

Install the programs with:

    $ dune build @install
    $ dune install

## Usage

The user guide is in [chase.xhtml](https://ramsdell.github.io/chase/index.html).

```
$ chase -h
Usage: chase [OPTIONS] [INPUT]
Options:
  -o FILE  --output=FILE  output to file (default is standard output)
  -t       --terse        use terse output -- print only models
  -j       --just-one     find just one model
  -b INT   --bound=INT    set structure size bound (default 250)
  -l INT   --limit=INT    set step count limit (default 2000)
  -c       --compact      print structures compactly
  -s       --sexpr        print structures using S-expressions
  -m INT   --margin=INT   set output margin
  -q       --quant        read formulas using quantifier syntax
  -e       --explicit     print formulas using quantifier syntax
  -f       --flatten      print flattened formulas
  -p       --proc-time    print processor time in seconds
  -v       --version      print version number
  -h       --help         print this message

```

```
$ chasetree -h
Usage: chasetree [OPTIONS] [INPUT]
Options:
  -o FILE  --output=FILE  output to file (default is standard output)
  -r INT   --ratio=INT    set ratio between window heights (default 20%)
  -v       --version      print version number
  -h       --help         print this message

```

## Example

The syntax used for geometric theories is Geolog, a Prolog-like
syntax.  What follows is an example of a theory for conference
management.

```
$ cat cm.gl
% Conference Management

author(X) & paper(Y) & assigned(X, Y).
author(X) & paper(Y) => read_score(X, Y) | conflict(X, Y).
assigned(X, Y) & author(X) & paper(Y) => read_score(X, Y).
assigned(X, Y) & conflict(X, Y) => false.
$

```

A run of the chase program produces the following output.

```
$ chase cm.gl
% chase version 1.2
% bound = 50, limit = 500
% ********
% author(X) & paper(Y) & assigned(X, Y). % (0)
% author(X) & paper(Y) => read_score(X, Y) | conflict(X, Y). % (1)
% assigned(X, Y) & author(X) & paper(Y) => read_score(X, Y). % (2)
% assigned(X, Y) & conflict(X, Y) => false. % (3)
% ********

(0)[]

(1,0){0}[assigned(x, y), author(x), paper(y)]

(2,1){1}![assigned(x, y), author(x), paper(y), read_score(x, y)]

(3,1){1}[assigned(x, y), author(x), conflict(x, y), paper(y)]

(4,3){2}[assigned(x, y), author(x), conflict(x, y), paper(y),
  read_score(x, y)]
```

A run of the chase produces structures assembled into a tree.  The
root of the tree is labeled (0).  A label of the form (n, p) gives the
node number of the tree node and its parent.  The form {r} records the
rule used to produce this structure.  A structure marked with ! is a
model.  Thus in this output, there are two paths explored, <0,1,2> and
<0,1,3,4>, and one model found (2).

More examples are in the tst directory.

A graphical view of chase output is constructed by chasetree.

```
$ chase -o cm.text cm.gl
$ chasetree -o cm.xhtml cm.text
```

## Makefile

The file chase.mk contains make rules for the chase program.  A sample
makefile that uses chase.mk follows.

```
include chase.mk

TXTS	:= $(patsubst %.gl,%.txt,$(wildcard *.gl)) \
		$(patsubst %.glx,%.txt,$(wildcard *.glx))

all:	$(TXTS)

clean:
	-rm $(TXTS)
```

## Emacs Users

Syntax error messages produced by the chase include Emacs style
location information.  Use M-x compile to run the chase and C-x ` to
move to the sequent that caused the error message.  When other error
messages include position information, it points to the position of
period in the formula that caused the problem.

## Development

The software uses ocamlbuild for development and testing.  To run the
tests in the tst directory, type:

    $ make; (cd tst; make)
