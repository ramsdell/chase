# Total Ordering

The Total Ordering Example is very simple.  It asserts the existence
of two numbers, and asserts they are totally ordered.

```
num(a) & num(b).
num(X) & num(Y) => lt(X, Y) | X = Y | lt(Y, X).
```

The structures generated by a run of Chase on the Total Ordering
Example are shown below.  An arrow connects a parent structure with a
child.  The boxed structures are models of the theory.

As expected, Chase finds three models.

You can see the steps taken by Chase by typing:

    $ chase -o total_ordering.text total_ordering.md
    $ chasetree -o total_ordering.xhtml total_ordering.text

and then opening `total_ordering.xhtml` in a browser.
