# Literate Theories Using Markdown

This document presents a collection of simple Chase theories written
in a literate style.  In this style, theories are explained using
English, and interspersed within the explanation are snippets of
Chase input.  Each theory is written using Markdown, and Chase axioms
are extracted from fenced code blocks within the source file.
