The latexcode program provides simple literate programming by
commenting out all but code environments in a LaTeX source file.  It
can be used with any language that provides line-oriented commenting,
ones in which a comments starts with one or more characters and
continues to the end of a line.  For example, // provides
line-oriented commenting for the C programing language.
